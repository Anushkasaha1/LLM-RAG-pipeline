SOFTWARE ENGINEERING OVERVIEW
Software engineering focuses on designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems in a structured and reliable manner.

CORE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
- Modularity
- Reusability
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Reliability
- Performance optimization

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)
1. Requirement analysis
2. System design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

BACKEND DEVELOPMENT
Backend development handles server-side logic, APIs, databases, and authentication.

POPULAR BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES
- Node.js
- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Go

APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (APIs)
APIs allow communication between different systems.

COMMON HTTP METHODS
- GET: Retrieve data
- POST: Create data
- PUT: Update data
- DELETE: Remove data

REST API PRINCIPLES
- Stateless communication
- Resource-based URLs
- Client-server architecture

DATABASE SYSTEMS
Databases store and manage structured or unstructured data.

TYPES OF DATABASES
Relational Databases (SQL):
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

NoSQL Databases:
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Cassandra

SQL VS NOSQL
SQL: databases use fixed schemas and strong consistency.
NoSQL: databases support flexible schemas and horizontal scalability.

DATA ENGINEERING
Data engineering focuses on collecting, transforming, validating, and storing data.

DATA PIPELINE STAGES
1. Data ingestion
2. Data cleaning
3. Data transformation
4. Data storage
5. Analytics or ML usage

ETL AND ELT
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load.
ELT loads raw data before transformation.

BIG DATA CONCEPTS
Big data is defined by:
- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety
- Veracity
- Value

BIG DATA TOOLS
- Hadoop
- Spark
- Kafka

DATA CLEANING TASKS
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing formats
- Fixing inconsistencies

DATA STORAGE FORMATS
- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet
- Avro
- TXT

INDEXING
Indexes improve search and lookup performance.

TYPES OF INDEXES
- B-tree index
- Hash index
- Inverted index
- Vector index

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (IR)
Information retrieval focuses on finding relevant documents based on a query.

IR COMPONENTS
- Query processing
- Ranking
- Similarity scoring
- Relevance estimation

SEMANTIC SEARCH
Semantic search understands meaning instead of exact keywords.
It relies on embeddings to find similar content.

EVALUATION METRICS
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
- nDCG

SECURITY AND PRIVACY
Security ensures protection of data and systems.

SECURITY PRACTICES
- Encryption
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Access control
- Secure storage

LOGGING AND MONITORING
Used to track application behavior and detect issues.

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINES
Common environments:
- Development
- Staging
- Production

DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
- Docker
- CI/CD pipelines

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
- Search engines
- Chatbots
- Recommendation systems
- Enterprise knowledge bases
- Document question-answering systems
- AI assistants

SUMMARY
Modern intelligent systems combine software engineering, data management, retrieval techniques, and language models to deliver accurate, scalable, and reliable applications.
